## Introduction
### Motivation
  It is no lie that the discovery of new material leads to the development of new products with better performances. 
Many laboratories and institutions are seeking through the broad area of material space to find materials with better properties than before.

  AMMD (Applied Mechanics & Materials Design) Laboratory is one of these seekers; using combinatorial experiments, AMMD lab studies novel functional/structural materials.
The combinatorial (high-throughput) experiment is more effective than the conventional technique since it can map out a broad composition group with a single experiment.
By depositing the thin film over the substrate with uneven distribution of the material, the material group with a wide combination of composition is acquired. 
In addition, rapid characterization tools have been developed to map out the property of the materials with different compositions.

  AMMD DB is a high-throughput experiment material property database of the data acquired from the combinatorial experiments.
It is developed to preserve the characterization data generated from the laboratory and to enable computational analysis such as machine learning.
The researcher's interest is based on the experimental result that fits the purpose of the experiment. 
However, this may lead to the loss of the generated data that does not fit the research goal.
Also, the unstandardized formatting of each researcher of the characterization data causes a waste of time on reformatting the data to fit the analysis method by different researchers.
Both are the obstacle for the massive analyzation of the material data. The former reduces the amount and abundance of data and the latter becomes a bigger problem as the amount of data becomes vast.
AMMD DB & Platform prevents these problem by offering easy and standardized data storage of the data generated from high-throughput experiments.

  AMMD DB Platform works as a client which connects the AMMD DB server and user. Through the AMMD DB Platform, user can upload, update, retrieve, and download the data, and manage the database itself.
The platform is consist of the logbook tab, search tab, upload tab, manage tab, and the result window.
Through the logbook tab and upload tab, user can upload the substrate sample information and characterization data generated through the high-throughput experiments, and search the sample of interest using the search tab. The detailed manual of each tab are described below.

  Through the logbook tab, the user can upload the deposition condition of the synthesized substrate sample. It is recommended to put the information in detail to enable the regeneration of the sample.
You can either ___browse the current sample list___ and ___input new sample information___ with this tab.

The ```Logbook table``` shows the list of the sample in the database.
